Q6. What is DDL Interpreter?

Answer:
	It interprets DDL statements and record them in tables containing metadata.
Its a language in database through which you can make the logical design of the schemas.

The most common command types in DDL are CREATE, ALTER and DROP. All three types have a predefined syntax that must be followed 
for the command to run and changes to take effect.

1. CREATE:
Syntax

CREATE TABLE [table name] ([column definitions]) [table parameters];
CREATE DATABASE defines a logical database under the active location root directory. The database normally consists of a 
subdirectory of the same name that holds the physical table and index files. Users can use stogroups to implicitly specify 
different storage directories for individual database objects.
CREATE TABLE creates a table by defining its columns and each column's data type and field length. The command can also be used 
to create primary and foreign keys for the table.

2. DROP
Syntax

DROP object type object name;
DROP DATABASE does the exact opposite of the CREATE DATABASE It deletes a database defined at a certain location, along with 
all the objects logically associated with it. It also deletes the database subdirectory even if it is empty and contains no objects 
logically associated with the database.
DROP TABLE deletes a database table and all associated indexes, views and synonyms built on it.

3. ALTER
Syntax

ALTER object type object name parameters;
ALTER TABLE adds, removes or alters columns and their data types. It can also enforce referential and domain integrity by 
creating or dropping UNIQUE, PRIMARY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK constraints in XDB mode. In Db2 mode, the command can also be used 
to enforce uniqueness constraints.

4. TRUNCATE
Syntax

TRUNCATE tablename/databasename;
TRUNCATE is used to quickly remove all records from a table, while preserving its full structure so it can be reused later.
