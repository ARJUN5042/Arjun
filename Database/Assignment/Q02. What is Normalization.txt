Q2.) What is Normalization?

Answer:-
	Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
Normalization is used to minimize  the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is used to eliminate undesirable 
characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.
Normalization divides the larges thable into smaller and links them using relationships.
The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.

The main reason for normalizing the relations is removing thesr anomalies. Failure to eliminate anomalies leads to data redundancy 
and can cause data intergrity and other problems as the database grows.
Normalization consists of a series of guidelines that helps to guide you in creating a good database structure.

Data modification anomalies can be categorized into three types:
1)Insetion Anomaly: Insertion Anomaly refers to when one cannot insert a new tuple into a relationship due to lack of data.
2)Deletion Anomaly: The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of 
		    some other important data.
3)Updatation Anomaly: The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.

Advantages of Normalization:
-Normalization helps to minimize data redundancy.
-Greater overall database organization.
-Data consistancy within the database.
-Much more flexible database design.
-Enforces the concept of relational integrity.

Disadvantages of Normalization:
-You cannot start building the database before knowing what the user needs.
-The performance degrades when normalizing  the relations to higher normal forms, i.e., 4NF, 5NF.
-It is very time-consuming and difficult to normalize of a higher degree.
Careless decomposition may lead to a bad database design, leading to serious problems.
