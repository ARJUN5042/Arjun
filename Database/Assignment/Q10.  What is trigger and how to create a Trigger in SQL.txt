Q10.  What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?

Answer:
	A trigger is a set of SQL statements that reside in system memory with unique names. 
It is a specialized category of stored procedure that is called automatically when a database server event occurs. 
Each trigger is always associated with a table.

A trigger is called a special procedure because it cannot be called directly like a stored procedure. 
The key distinction between the trigger and procedure is that a trigger is called automatically when a data modification 
event occurs against a table. A stored procedure, on the other hand, must be invoked directly.

The following are the main characteristics that distinguish triggers from stored procedures:
->We cannot manually execute/invoked triggers.
->Triggers have no chance of receiving parameters.
->A transaction cannot be committed or rolled back inside a trigger.

Syntax of Trigger:
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name AFTER {INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE} ON table_name FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN

{SQL_Statements}

END

For Example,

creating database-->
CREATE DATABASE trigger_db;

creating table-->
CREATE TABLE test
(
    id int(10),
    name varchar(200),
    date_time timestamp,
    action_performed varchar(200)
);

creating 2nd table-->
CREATE TABLE candidates
(
    c_id int(10),
    c_name varchar(200)
);
INSERT INTO candidates(c_id,c_name) VALUES(1,"Manav");

creating triggers-->

DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER insert_trigger AFTER INSERT ON candidates FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN

INSERT INTO test(id,name,action_performed) VALUES(new.c_id,new.c_name,"Record Inserted");

END

insert data
INSERT INTO candidates(c_id,c_name) VALUES(2,"Arjun");

Update Data with trigger-->

DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER update_trigger AFTER UPDATE ON candidates FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN

INSERT INTO test(id,name,action_performed) VALUES(new.c_id,new.c_name,"Record Updated");

END

INSERT INTO candidates(c_id,c_name) VALUES(3,"Satyam");
UPDATE candidates SET c_name="Dharmik" WHERE c_id=3;

delete data with trigger-->

DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER delete_trigger AFTER DELETE ON candidates FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN

INSERT INTO test(id,name,action_performed) VALUES(old.c_id,old.c_name,"Record Deleted");

END

INSERT INTO candidates(c_id,c_name) VALUES(4,"Dharmik");
DELETE FROM candidates WHERE c_id=3;
