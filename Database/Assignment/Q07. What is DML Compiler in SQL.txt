Q7. What is DML Compiler in SQL?

Answer:
	Translates DML statements in a query language within low level instructions understandable through the query 
	evaluation engine. Attempts to transforms users request within an equivalent and well-organized from for executing 
	the query understandable through Data Manager, Interprets DDL statements and records them within a set of tables 
	containing Meta data in a form that can be used through other elements of a DBMS. 

Following are the four main DML commands in SQL:

1. SELECT Command :
	SELECT is the most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language. The SELECT command shows 
	the records of the specified table. It also shows the particular record of a particular column by using the WHERE clause.

Syntax:
SELECT column_Name_1, column_Name_2, ….., column_Name_N FROM Name_of_table;  
SELECT * FROM table_name;
SELECT FROM table_name WHERE column_name=value;

2. INSERT Command :
	INSERT is another most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language, which allows users 
	to insert data in database tables.

Syntax:
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME ( column_Name1 , column_Name2 , column_Name3 , .... column_NameN )  
VALUES (value_1, value_2, value_3, .... value_N ) ;

3. UPDATE Command :
	UPDATE is another most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language, which allows users to update or 
	modify the existing data in database tables.

Syntax:
UPDATE Table_name SET [column_name1= value_1, ….., column_nameN = value_N] WHERE CONDITION;

4. DELETE Command :
	DELETE is a DML command which allows SQL users to remove single or multiple existing records from the database tables.
	This command of Data Manipulation Language does not delete the stored data permanently from the database. 
	We use the WHERE clause with the DELETE command to select specific rows from the table.

Syntax:
DELETE FROM Table_Name WHERE condition;
